Run `npm outdated`.  For each outdated package version update the corresponding version number in package.json. Then run `npm install` and then `npm outdated` to verify the updates worked. Then run `npm update` to update all other dependencies. Do all of this work on a new branch (named "update-dependencies-yyyymmdd-hhmmss") and when done you should add, commit, push, and create a PR with a title and description using the Github CLI. Do not update @types/node NPM package to a new major version. Also, any other major version NPM updates must each be done on their own, separate branch.
